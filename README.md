# ScandiPWA_QuoteGraphQl

**QuoteGraphQl** provides basic types and resolvers for Checkout steps.

> ⚠️ This module is WIP

## TODO

1. Implement Checkout resolvers (alternatives of REST API):
    - estimate-shipping-methods ✅
    - shipping-information ✅
    - payment-information ✅
    - cart GET  ✅
    - cart POST
2. Implement schema (mutations) declarations ✅
3. Test all three endpoints. 
    - Potentially blocked by Cart quote features.
